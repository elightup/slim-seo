== Description ==

### A Fast & Automated SEO Plugin For WordPress

Currently there are many SEO plugins for WordPress in the market. But these plugins often have too many options and are very complicated for ordinary users. Access to their configuration section, you will easily get lost in a maze of explanations and options that you sometimes don't understand. Besides, there are ads!

**So how can an ordinary user use an SEO plugin?**

SEO should be an integrated part of WordPress, where users don't need or need very little effort to configure for SEO. The main reason is that not everyone understands the terms of SEO and how to configure them optimally.

So, we made [**Slim SEO**](https://wpslimseo.com).

Slim SEO is a full-featured SEO plugin, that's done right! It provides a complete SEO solution for WordPress where the configuration has been done automatically. Users do not need to care about their complex and semantic options.

So what does Slim SEO do?

### Slim SEO Features

Slim SEO helps you do the following jobs automatically:

#### 1. Meta Tags

The following meta tags are auto-generated and optimized for the best SEO scores.

- [Meta title tag](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/meta-title-tag/): display your title in a SEO-friendly way.
- [Meta description tag](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/meta-description-tag/): auto generate from posts/pages excerpt or content.
- [Meta robots tag](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/meta-robots-tag/): decide which pages are indexed and which ones not.
- [Facebook Open Graph Tags](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/facebook-open-graph-tags/): share your posts on Facebook beautifully.
- [Twitter Card Tags](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/twitter-card-tags/): share your posts on Twitter beautifully.
- LinkedIn meta tags

#### 2. [XML Sitemap](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/xml-sitemap/)

Slim SEO automatically generates XML sitemap (at `domain.com/sitemap.xml`) to submit to search engines. With XML sitemaps, your website are indexed fast and completely.

Besides the normal XML sitemap, Slim SEO also includes sitemaps for images and Google news.

#### 3. [Breadcrumbs](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/breadcrumbs/)

The plugin allows you to output a breadcrumb trail on your website easily. It automatically fetches the information from the current post and output a hierarchy for you. You can also style the breadcrumbs to match your theme style.

#### 4. [Schema (Structured Data)](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/schema/)

Schema is a way that describes structured data for search engines. Based on the data provided, search engines can show the content in the search results page in a more appealing way.

Slim SEO automatically adds the some structured data to the website via JSON-LD which makes your website more SEO-friendly. Not only schemas are created by the plugin, there are also meaningful connections between them. For example, an article (single post) is the main entity of the current webpage. Slim SEO does that all without any configuration.

#### 5. [Redirection](https://docs.wpslimseo.com/slim-seo/redirection/)

== Installation ==

Before installing, please note that the plugin requires PHP >= 7.2.

1. Go to Plugins > Add New.
2. Search for "Slim SEO".
3. Install and activate the plugin.

That's all. The plugin doesn't have any settings page. Everything is done automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How meta title tag is generated? =

WordPress already has this featured! All we need to do is add theme support for `title-tag`. By default, the title tag will have the following format:

For homepage: Site title - Site description
For single page or post: Page/Post title - Site title
For other pages: Page title - Site title

This format is pretty good!

= How meta description tag is generated? =

The meta description tag is automatically generated from the post excerpt or post content (in case you didn't enter post excerpt). For categories, post tags or custom taxonomies, their description will be used as meta description.

= How Open Graph meta tags is generated? =

Open Graph inherits the meta title and meta description. For image tag, it gets from the featured image.

For single posts, the plugin also provides detailed information for article section (the first post category) and article tags (post tags). It also provides additional information such as published time and modified time.

Other tags such as `url`, `site_name`, `type`, `locale` are quite obvious.

= How Twitter card meta tags is generated? =

Twitter inherits some tags from Open Graph such as title, description and image. So we only need to set the card type to large image, so the posts appear beautifully on Twitter.

= How do I set meta tags for my homepage? =

If your homepage is a static page, then it's treated like a normal page. The meta description is generated from page content, and the featured image will be used for Open Graph tags.

If your homepage shows latest posts, then it's already done automatically by the plugin.

= Can I change the meta tags manually? =

Yes, you can. When you edit a post or a page, there's a "Search Engine Optimization" meta box below the editor, which allows you to edit meta tags if needed.

= Where is my XML sitemap? =

The sitemap URL is located at `domain.com/sitemap.xml`.

= How to remove plugin's data when uninstalling =

Add the following constant in your `wp-config.php` file:

`define( 'SLIM_SEO_DELETE_DATA', true );`
